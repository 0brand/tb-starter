<h1>SecBrowser &trade;</h1>

<h2>A security hardened, non-anonymous browser.</h2>

<p>SecBrowser &trade; is a security focused browser that provides better protection from exploits, thereby reducing the risk of a virus infection. Enhanced usability is achieved with a built-in security slider that can be used to easily disable web site features that increase attack surface such as JavaScript. Since many of the features that are commonly exploited in browsers are disabled by default, SecBrowser &trade; attack surface is greatly reduced. In the default configuration, SecBrowser &trade; offers better security than Firefox, Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge without any customizations necessary. <a href=https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design>[1]</a> It also has better protections from <a href=https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Data_Collection_Techniques>online tracking</a>, <a href=http://www.whonix.org/wiki/Data_Collection_Techniques#Fingerprinting_of_Browser_.28HTTP.29_Header>browser fingerprinting</a> and reduces users linkability across websites.</p>

<p>SecBrowser &trade; is a derivative of Tor&reg; Browser Bundle. This means unlike Tor Browser, SecBrowser &trade; does <u>not</u> route traffic over the Tor&reg; network, which in common parlance is referred to as "clearnet" traffic. Even without the aid of the Tor&reg; network, SecBrowser &trade; still benefits from the numerous <a href=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git>patches</a> that Tor&reg; developers merged into the code base. Even with developer skills, these enhancements would be arduous and time consuming to duplicate in other browsers, with the outcome unlikely to match SecBrowser &trade; many security benefits. While users can install browser extensions to mitigate specific attack vectors. Its unlikely to compare to SecBrowser &trade; which leverages the experience and know how of the Tor Project devs and the battle tested Tor Browser.

<p>Improvements to this SecBrowser &trade; local welcome page <a href=https://github.com/Whonix/tb-starter/blob/master/usr/share/secbrowser/secbrowser.html>are welcome</a>.</p>

<p>SecBrowser &trade; is produced independently from the Tor&reg; anonymity software and carries no guarantee from <a href=https://www.torproject.org>The Tor&reg; Project</a> about quality, suitability or anything else.</p>
